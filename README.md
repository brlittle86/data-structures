# data-structures

- Our approach to Linked Lists was to simply create two Classes, one for the Node and one for the list itself. The Node contains 3 things: the Data and Next properties, and a constructor. The Linked List makes use of the Node objects and chains them together via their Next properties, while maintaining a reference to the Head.
