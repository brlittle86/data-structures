# data-structures

- Our approach to Linked Lists was to simply create two Classes, one for the Node and one for the list itself. The Node contains 3 things: the Data and Next properties, and a constructor. The Linked List makes use of the Node objects and chains them together via their Next properties, while maintaining a reference to the Head.

- Our approach to the Linked List method FindMiddleNode was to find the length of the Linked List, divide the length in half (rounding down with Math.Floor()), and then iterate down the Linked List that number of Nodes.

- For Doubly Linked Lists, it is almost identical to Singly Linked Lists, however, we accounted for the ability to look at a previous Node, as well. This changes how we delete and add, but little else.
